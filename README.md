## 💡 Inspiration

As a developer, I enjoy exploring design in my free time. Volunteering for the CRT Club at ISSTE gave me an opportunity to blend my technical background with my passion for creative work. These designs reflect my effort to contribute to the club’s initiatives and events, including their blood donation drive.
